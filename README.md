# SharpAuth

.NET API for account management with Google OAuth, maybe I'll be using it on a future project!

### Functionalities
- Register
- Log in
- Token sender
- Recover password
- Manage account
- Google OAuth

### Tools used
- (TL Draw)[https://www.tldraw.com/]: For building a schema for SharpAuth

### Why should you star it?
I'm not brand new to developing, but I need to have a reasonable portfolio, and I believe this is a good
component for what I aim to do next as a dev, to see if I'm doing good (so it would be nice to have some stars
here S2)
